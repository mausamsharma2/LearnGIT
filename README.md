git commit -m "some meaningfull message related to code" : the record of change

git push origin main : to push your code to the remote(Github) repository

created index.html and now we are going to push it into our repository

git checkout : to go to another branch
git checkout -b <-branch name-> : creates and switch to new branch

(Branch: git creates a copy to the same code for you to add some changes in the branch and not let you effect the original branch)
